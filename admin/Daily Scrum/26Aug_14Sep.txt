We'll probably meet on Monday
Don't forget daily scrum

And if you're waiting for code/firebase sturcture before you can complete your task feel free to tell them to hurry up on the group
[2020/08/26, 16:00:59] Demi: *structure
[2020/08/26, 16:02:03] Julian Jacobs Wits.: we didn't discuss how image uploading was going to work
[2020/08/26, 16:02:28] Julian Jacobs Wits.: idk if Demi has to do anything specific on Firebase's end for that
[2020/08/26, 16:02:56] Demi: Oh ya.
[2020/08/26, 16:05:13] Demi: If I'm correct firebase has a structure that lets's you store images so I'll look into that and let you know by Friday

Can we also try and have some chats in between check ins?

[2020/08/29, 15:49:42] Demi: Senate add a place for uploading pictures in the sell page/tab/whatever it is
[2020/08/29, 15:50:10] Demi: Yo Julian 
So I checked the image stuff and you can upload images directly to firebase via cloud storage 

What I had in mind is we do it directly under the users collection and have sub collections showing books you have for sale and transaction history. 
Most of this will have to be done in the front end so I wanted to ask if I should do it? Or if you'll do it? 
Main reason I'm asking is cause you already have something to do and I don't wanna give too much work

I'll manually do one on the firebase side as a template either ways
[2020/08/29, 15:51:17] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: yeah that sounds fine it doesn't sound like it would be extremely complex

Tasks are up on tiaga. Click on em for description 

Next meeting is on the 7th of September at 3:30pm. We won't meet this week cause of the study break but make sure your task is done by the 7th

Lemme know if there's a problem
[2020/08/31, 09:01:39] Demi: @⁨Julian⁩ 
The books collection should hold the current books up for sale. 
Each user will have a sold and bought sub collection for their transactions history and the document id should be the exact same document ID from the books table.
There's an example with user Barry(PzYw...)

When someone buys a book it updates the sold and bought sub collection under the individual users and deletes the book from the books collection.

Every meal has an average rating field
[2020/08/31, 09:32:40] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: Can I ask that the UI and frontend be done well before the 7th to give me enough time to do my part before the 7th? 

Also what are we planning on doing about the security breach email from Firebase saying that there’s sensitive information on our Github?

[2020/09/05, 15:43:15] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: Or should I do a cumulative diagram for every task ?
[2020/09/05, 15:46:45] Demi: Uhm ya you can just do all the diagram update at once and upload it under the very last task. Or upload it to the taiga wiki and label it properly 

Also upload it to github wiki 
If it's already there then update it to the latest one
[2020/09/05, 15:47:35] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: Ok cool I’ll upload it to the wikis

[2020/09/06, 00:01:31] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: This code is from then, the new code navigates from the main page to the meal page of that dining hall

[2020/09/06, 12:35:16] Demi: Check in

I had to change the security rules cause I kept getting an email that said we needed to secure our rules or else we won't be allowed to edit the code
Give me a sec to figure it out, if you need the back end urgently you can change it to it's previous rules

[2020/09/06, 12:36:57] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: I just need to see the changes, I’ll just bypass logging in
[2020/09/06, 12:37:37] Demi: Cool
[2020/09/06, 12:42:52] Demi: I think I fixed it for now
[2020/09/06, 14:25:45] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: Yeah I can log in but can’t place orders for meals
[2020/09/06, 14:27:04] Demi: Cool
I'm beginning to understand how the security rules work
I'll fix that before tomorrow
[2020/09/06, 14:27:22] Demi: If you need to use it urgently I can quickly write something
[2020/09/06, 14:36:40] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: No no not at all
[2020/09/06, 14:36:49] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: I was just making you aware
[2020/09/06, 14:40:46] Kabelo AKA Kabi: demi, where exactly are the firebase functions that you are writing?
[2020/09/06, 14:47:21] Demi: Oh cool
Thanks
Ya I'm gonna fix that, I'm still watching videos to completely understand security rules
[2020/09/06, 14:47:56] Demi: Firebase console
Then go to cloud firestore then go to the rules tab
[2020/09/06, 14:48:20] Demi: But apparently you can test it via javascript/node/typescript but that's your choice
[2020/09/06, 14:56:24] Kabelo AKA Kabi: never heard of that
[2020/09/06, 14:58:25] Kabelo AKA Kabi: i'm doing with the local emulator. shouldnt the rules showing up on github? in the firestorm.rules file
[2020/09/06, 14:59:46] Demi: No idea
Just go have a look, I haven't done alot yet
[2020/09/06, 15:00:48] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: My ionic isn’t detecting the ionic5-star-rating tag, is there a way to fix that
[2020/09/06, 15:01:17] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: I already deleted and reinstalled dependencies and it still isn’t being detected
[2020/09/06, 15:02:59] Demi: Ya I also can't see any stars
And the number goes above 5, is there a way to make sure it doesn't go above 5?
[2020/09/06, 15:03:20] Demi: Also I don't think we need the short comment section
But we can leave it in
[2020/09/06, 15:08:03] Senate⚡️: Yeah I know😓 I’m still trying to work around that. It’s been killing me for weeks now. But I’m hoping for a breakthrough soon. If I don’t get it to work properly by tomorrow then I’m going to manipulate buttons
[2020/09/06, 15:09:33] Senate⚡️: Yeah, the number goes above 5. I was thinking we would use toast notifications to let the user correct it but it’s irrelevant now since we’re doing stars
[2020/09/06, 15:12:43] Demi: Oh cool
[2020/09/06, 15:13:05] Demi: @27813501310 @27727232970 are you having any problems?
[2020/09/06, 15:16:12] Senate⚡️: Didnt Rylan say something about displaying 5 most recent comments?
[2020/09/06, 15:18:08] Kabelo AKA Kabi: i'm getting there lmao this firebase stuff is so new to me
[2020/09/06, 15:19:42] Kabelo AKA Kabi: ah yes it your new code is showing now
[2020/09/06, 15:19:48] Demi: I thought he wanted us to switch to the ratings system completely 
But I probably misheard so we can leave it in

Just limit the word count of the short comments
[2020/09/06, 15:20:21] Demi: Aiit
[2020/09/06, 15:33:43] Senate⚡️: Oh, I could have also misinterpreted 🤷🏽‍♀️ okay. Once I get the stars working I’ll limit the word count
[2020/09/06, 15:44:58] Demi: Julain whenever you're sending data to the backend 
Make sure there's a field called 'uid' it's a string that should contain the user id of the current signed in user(getcurrentuser())


This doesn't have to be done for the sign in and create user page
[2020/09/06, 15:45:54] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: Will do
[2020/09/06, 15:46:22] Demi: I've done the security rules for the making review 
It should work now.
I checked convocation and it does retrieve the meals and descriptions
[2020/09/06, 15:47:02] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: That part of the front is done so I’ll get right on that

[2020/09/06, 17:00:43] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: What’s the difference between logRatingChange and submitReview
[2020/09/06, 17:02:20] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: Also would this need me to be in the make-review page because I get an error and can’t see anything on that page
[2020/09/06, 17:06:58] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: I saw it
[2020/09/06, 17:07:11] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: Mine has a black background though
[2020/09/06, 17:07:17] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: But I’m not running in the lab
[2020/09/06, 17:33:47] Kabelo AKA Kabi: so in the database, how are we uniquely identifying every user? that the debase recognizes?
[2020/09/06, 17:34:02] Kabelo AKA Kabi: *database
[2020/09/06, 17:37:06] Kabelo AKA Kabi: oh nevermind. each student email gets it's own uid
[2020/09/06, 17:38:29] Kabelo AKA Kabi: can someone please quickly login in with one of the student emails already in the database? app doesn't run for me so i can't
[2020/09/06, 17:42:42] Senate⚡️: I haven’t really worked on the ts. It’s just a whole lot of garbage from my failed attempts
[2020/09/06, 17:43:20] Senate⚡️: Oh 🤔 I’m not sure why that is but I’ve changed the approach so it might not matter
[2020/09/06, 17:43:37] Senate⚡️: Okay thanks
[2020/09/06, 17:43:47] Senate⚡️: Okay yeah. It’s just one big mess
[2020/09/06, 17:44:39] Senate⚡️: The star rating was damn near impossible. This is what I’ve resolved to do:

[2020/09/06, 17:45:53] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: Idk I think that’s for Rylan to say
[2020/09/06, 17:46:33] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: You could always explain that you’re working towards the star rating system unless you just want it to be this entirely
[2020/09/06, 17:47:47] Senate⚡️: Okay. Hopefully he says it’s fine. Do you personally find it intuitive? Cause I think that’s why he wanted the star rating
[2020/09/06, 17:48:53] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: It seems intuitive to me
[2020/09/06, 17:49:10] Senate⚡️: I don’t know if I’ll ever get there 😓 from my research, it seems like they changed rating mechanisms in ionic5 and I can’t find any working resources on how to do it now
[2020/09/06, 17:49:10] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: It’s also really creative so I like it
[2020/09/06, 17:49:25] Senate⚡️: Great, we’ll see what he says
[2020/09/06, 17:49:38] Senate⚡️: 👌🏽
[2020/09/06, 18:00:55] Demi: Same
[2020/09/07, 09:31:02] Kabelo AKA Kabi: Check in
[2020/09/07, 10:30:54] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: ‎Check in
[2020/09/07, 10:32:36] Senate⚡️: Check in 
[2020/09/06, 10:36:13] Duduzile Coms: Check in
[2020/09/07, 10:52:08] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: I can’t access the buy-books page
[2020/09/07, 10:52:24] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: Idk it says it can’t fine the module
[2020/09/07, 10:52:35] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: What’s the route for it
[2020/09/07, 11:20:32] Senate⚡️: It’s a child of main tabs 🤔
[2020/09/07, 11:21:14] Senate⚡️: I’ll check it out. I’m not sure what the problem is. I could access it in the ams
[2020/09/07, 11:21:25] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: I’ll try running from the test branch. I merged it into mine but maybe not everything came across
‎[2020/09/07, 11:21:55] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: ‎image omitted
[2020/09/07, 11:22:51] Senate⚡️: Oh I see. It changed the name of the module
[2020/09/07, 11:23:41] Senate⚡️: Actually it didn’t
[2020/09/07, 11:24:03] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: It works. Ow
[2020/09/07, 11:24:04] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: Now
[2020/09/07, 11:24:15] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: I don’t know what changed but I got through
[2020/09/07, 11:25:16] Senate⚡️: Yeah I was about to say, the same thing happened to me yesterday. Like it didn’t work. Then I literally copied and pasted what was already there and it worked😅
[2020/09/07, 11:25:35] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: Now it’s saying I have missing insufficient permissions
[2020/09/07, 11:25:36] Senate⚡️: I thought it was a minor android studio moment but now it might be lasting 👀
[2020/09/07, 11:25:57] Senate⚡️: Yeah, I think Demi’s on that. I told him last night
[2020/09/07, 11:26:58] Demi: Check in

I fixed it though
[2020/09/07, 11:27:31] Demi: Are you sending the uid of the current user signed in user?
[2020/09/07, 11:28:02] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: I haven’t made any changes to the code Senate gave me
[2020/09/07, 11:28:38] Senate⚡️: Am I meant to? The user is already sign in at that point
[2020/09/07, 11:29:59] Demi: Yes but it has to make sure it's the correct user signed in. In order to write otherwise someone else might edit their book 
But anyone can read
[2020/09/07, 11:30:10] Demi: As far as they're logged in
[2020/09/07, 11:31:08] Demi: The field should be called uid a string containing the uid(getcurrentuser() is the function or something similar)
[2020/09/07, 11:35:39] Senate⚡️: There isn’t an edit function so that’s not really a risk 🤷🏽‍♀️ unless we want to add an edit function
[2020/09/07, 11:38:46] Demi: Adding the optional extra photos is editing.
And we might want to add an edit button in case someone mistyped something in the description or title

Also it's safer well that's what the videos said
[2020/09/07, 11:39:21] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: Also I think there are too many pages. It’s becoming difficult to keep track of the pages and their routes
[2020/09/07, 11:40:12] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: We have 3 pages with “main” in the  name and different groups of pages route to other different pages and it’s becoming elaborate
[2020/09/07, 11:42:59] Senate⚡️: Okay cool
[2020/09/07, 11:43:49] Senate⚡️: Most of the pages don’t have special routes. Just the buy and sell books pages do
[2020/09/07, 11:44:10] Senate⚡️: Yeah it’s a bit of a problem. Would you like me change them?
[2020/09/07, 11:45:16] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: No I was thinking we could discuss it 3 but since you seem to be getting a hang of working with Firebase, maybe I could take what you have and make my task preserving your aesthetic but making it more modular
[2020/09/07, 11:45:28] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: We can discuss it at 3 tho
[2020/09/07, 11:46:11] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: Because we also have 2 routing structures and I figure the one you use makes it easier for you edit and view the pages
[2020/09/07, 11:46:45] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: But the one I made is meant for security of the app, so I could be taking your base an abstracting it to the app
[2020/09/07, 11:49:44] Senate⚡️: You can honestly do whatever works best. I’ll figure out what you did and polish whatever becomes distorted
[2020/09/07, 11:50:31] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: In that case I’ll push my changes to the main branch instead of the test branch
[2020/09/07, 11:52:11] Senate⚡️: Oh and nah 😂😂 trust me. I’m not really getting the hang of firebase 😅 I understand very little. The little that you see in the code is literally all that I know
[2020/09/07, 11:52:37] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: In that case I’ll continue to do that
[2020/09/07, 11:52:53] Senate⚡️: Great! Thank you?
[2020/09/07, 11:52:54] Senate⚡️: *!
[2020/09/07, 11:52:56] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: What’s left to do
[2020/09/07, 11:53:10] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: On the communicating with Firebase
[2020/09/07, 11:53:28] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: You seem to have done uploading images
[2020/09/07, 11:54:33] Senate⚡️: I’m not sure that the sell and buy pages work because of the permissions stuff. Actually, Demi, can you drop the restrictions just for testing purposes?
[2020/09/07, 11:54:52] Senate⚡️: But the uid stuff is actually outstanding
[2020/09/07, 11:55:00] Senate⚡️: Yeah, I’d like to think so
[2020/09/07, 11:55:58] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: I think there’s a special testing console version of Firebase that can be used for that
[2020/09/07, 11:56:07] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: But idk about it
[2020/09/07, 11:56:37] Senate⚡️: Also, my ionic lab is broken for the gazillionth time so I can present anything in the meeting
[2020/09/07, 11:56:48] Senate⚡️: Me neither
[2020/09/07, 12:02:47] Demi: Uhm that's a little difficult to do right now
[2020/09/07, 12:04:20] Senate⚡️: Oh okay. I guess we’ll verify it whenever you can or when the UID stuff is up. Whichever comes first
[2020/09/07, 12:07:01] Demi: What?
[2020/09/07, 12:20:45] Senate⚡️: We can check to see in the buying and selling pages work when you’ve taken down the permissions or when the uid stuff is sorted
[2020/09/07, 12:50:05] Demi: Just add the field Senate
It's like one line. Call the get current user function
The buying page should work cause all it needs is someone to be logged in, it doesn't matter who
[2020/09/07, 12:56:28] Senate⚡️: Okay 😬😬 I’ll try my best. Like I said, my understanding of fire base is v limited

It currently doesn’t work 🤷🏽‍♀️
[2020/09/07, 12:58:27] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: Today’s meeting is just us right?
[2020/09/07, 12:58:47] Senate⚡️: Yup
[2020/09/07, 12:58:55] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: Ok
‎[2020/09/07, 13:00:06] Senate⚡️: ‎image omitted
[2020/09/07, 13:00:37] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: I don’t think you’d need to sign in
[2020/09/07, 13:00:50] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: Actually
[2020/09/07, 13:01:09] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: What you could do is store the uid under AuthConstants
[2020/09/07, 13:02:10] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: But I feel like FireBase might keep track of whose logged on as part of the sign in event, but if Demi requires it to be explicit, you can create an AuthConstants field for the uid
[2020/09/07, 13:04:36] Demi: Ya you can can use either
Cause if you're signed in there's a function to get your info but you can also use the Authconstants whichever one is easier
[2020/09/07, 13:05:18] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: I’m pretty sure it would be something like auth.getCurrentUser(). I remember seeing that
[2020/09/07, 13:06:14] Senate⚡️: Okay, cool. That sounds manageable. What am I meant to then compare that value with?
[2020/09/07, 13:07:24] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: I have no clue I’m not sure what that does on Firebase’s side
[2020/09/07, 13:08:09] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: I think you’re asking like how do you pass that value to Firebase so that it can allow you to read and write?
[2020/09/07, 13:08:10] Demi: Don't do the comparison
Just send it with the data
[2020/09/07, 13:08:28] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: In what format?
[2020/09/07, 13:08:32] Demi: You know what lemme have a look at the code
[2020/09/07, 13:08:40] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: Like the data should have a uid field?
[2020/09/07, 13:08:59] Demi: Ya
[2020/09/07, 13:09:12] Demi: Wait I just realized it already had a field called owners
[2020/09/07, 13:09:29] Demi: *owner 
So we know who owns the  book
[2020/09/07, 13:09:34] Demi: *has
[2020/09/07, 13:10:03] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: I’m anxious for the meeting because I think we need to rethink how we plan our work
[2020/09/07, 13:11:06] Demi: Lol ya 
I didn't think the security rules were a big deal so I ignored it until recently
[2020/09/07, 13:13:03] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: Also if there’s a meeting and messages aren’t delivering to me, it’s probably loadshedding and I don’t have data
[2020/09/07, 13:15:12] Demi: Cool
[2020/09/07, 13:16:28] Senate⚡️: So does that change anything or am I still just passing the current user?
[2020/09/07, 13:19:12] Kabelo AKA Kabi: yes
[2020/09/07, 13:19:28] Kabelo AKA Kabi: yes to this too
[2020/09/07, 13:21:55] Demi: Just leave it for now
I'll have a look at the code
[2020/09/07, 13:25:10] Demi: @27787256911 is the make review working?
[2020/09/07, 13:26:55] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: In theory
[2020/09/07, 13:27:16] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: There’s no state information passed from the meal page to the review page
[2020/09/07, 13:27:30] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: So the review page doesn’t know which meal it’s reviewing
[2020/09/07, 13:28:40] Demi: Can we fix that?
Is there a way to pass information so it knows which meal it's reviewing? Then we need to test that
[2020/09/07, 13:30:59] Kabelo AKA Kabi: i think maybe it has to do with how we built our collections and documents in firebase. i'm not sure but looking at videos and stuff we need to rethink
[2020/09/07, 13:31:17] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: There might be
[2020/09/07, 13:31:31] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: I think Senate was working on it tho
[2020/09/07, 13:31:41] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: I think she wanted a drop down menu
[2020/09/07, 13:32:17] Demi: Nah nigga😂
That's completely unrelated
We're in Italy and you're in Lesotho
[2020/09/07, 13:32:31] Demi: Aiit
We'll talk about it in the meeting
[2020/09/07, 13:32:53] Demi: Do you know if it properly communicates with firebase though? Like with permissions and stuff?
[2020/09/07, 13:33:05] Kabelo AKA Kabi: oh damn aight let me go back into my hole
[2020/09/07, 13:39:39] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: It works theoretically
[2020/09/07, 13:39:49] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: Like with test data hardcoded
‎[2020/09/07, 13:40:05] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: ‎image omitted
[2020/09/07, 13:41:25] Demi: Ok cool
‎[2020/09/07, 13:41:31] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: ‎image omitted
[2020/09/07, 13:42:11] Demi: It helps in identifying who actually made the comment
[2020/09/07, 13:42:26] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: Ok so it’s not supposed to be like secure data
[2020/09/07, 13:42:43] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: So yeah the auth works
[2020/09/07, 13:42:43] Demi: Nah
If you're logged in then you can make a comment
[2020/09/07, 13:42:53] Demi: Cool
[2020/09/07, 14:10:09] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: I think I’ll log this as an issue?
[2020/09/07, 14:12:19] Demi: Yup
[2020/09/07, 15:45:22] Demi: https://firebase.google.com/docs/rules/unit-tests
[2020/09/07, 15:55:48] Kabelo AKA Kabi: the json array stuff is for realtime database 😞 this boy
‎[2020/09/07, 16:00:45] Demi: ‎image omitted
‎[2020/09/07, 16:01:36] Demi: ‎image omitted
[2020/09/08, 00:04:34] Demi: Nothing happens when I click on Text Books
Also the backend doesn't update when food is ordered and when comment is placed

How do I know if it's permissions issues?
[2020/09/08, 00:05:23] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: What does the console say
[2020/09/08, 00:05:42] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: I assume it’s that because I haven’t added the uid field

check in
[2020/09/08, 00:06:01] Demi: Debug console?
[2020/09/08, 00:06:22] Demi: Ok cool
[2020/09/08, 00:26:07] Demi: Fixed the order placing on the convocation page
[2020/09/08, 00:26:55] Demi: Yo Julian can you make the buy books page like the convocation page
Where it creates the menu based on everything on firebase Books collection?
[2020/09/08, 00:27:34] Demi: I'll do the rest
But if I don't you can just check the data line and see what needs to be changed
Also the imports line
[2020/09/08, 12:43:58] Demi: Check in


Put your task in progress if you're busy with it and close it if you're done
[2020/09/08, 12:46:39] Demi: Also @27732121491 @27787256911 there is a way to transfer information to the review page
You can use NavController
Just google it there are a bunch of videos and they're fairly easy
[2020/09/08, 12:52:44] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: Check in
[2020/09/08, 12:53:04] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: Should I do that instead of putting the reviews on the meal pages?
[2020/09/08, 12:55:00] Demi: I think so
Cause I feel like it's easier since the review page can then be called from the meal page
[2020/09/08, 12:56:21] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: Ok I’ll look into it
[2020/09/08, 13:01:42] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: But I’ve already started making the review section a component
[2020/09/08, 13:01:51] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: So I’ll see which would be easier
[2020/09/08, 13:10:28] Kabelo AKA Kabi: check in
[2020/09/08, 13:12:31] Senate⚡️: Check in
[2020/09/08, 13:57:17] Duduzile Coms: Check in 
[2020/09/08, 23:03:55] Demi: @27813501310 how's the progress?
Cause we need the build to pass and an increase in coverage
[2020/09/08, 23:11:07] Duduzile Coms: Besides the things Julian was telling me about the tests still fail. Even the ones without the fire base things so I’m still figuring it out
[2020/09/08, 23:24:23] Demi: Aiit
[2020/09/09, 13:57:49] Demi: Check in
[2020/09/09, 13:58:04] Demi: Julian the staff page isn't returning the correct amount of meals
Fix it
[2020/09/09, 13:58:36] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: Check in
[2020/09/09, 13:59:12] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: Ok
[2020/09/09, 14:01:01] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: Did you submit an issue
[2020/09/09, 14:04:00] Demi: I'll go do that now
[2020/09/09, 14:04:25] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: Could you also assign it to me so I can find it easier
[2020/09/09, 14:04:50] Demi: Ok
[2020/09/09, 14:04:52] Senate⚡️: Check in
[2020/09/09, 14:13:48] Kabelo AKA Kabi: check in
[2020/09/09, 14:13:23] Duduzile Coms: Check in 
[2020/09/10, 11:31:15] Demi: Check in
Is everyone almost done? Cause we're presenting to Rylan tomorrow
[2020/09/10, 11:32:36] Senate⚡️: Check in
[2020/09/10, 11:33:35] Senate⚡️: Yeah, I’ve done my bit. I’ll upload it later today. Also 😬 there’s a bit of a problem, Rylan still hasn’t RSVPd 😓
[2020/09/10, 11:37:17] Demi: Ok cool.
Email him directly
[2020/09/10, 11:38:54] Demi: Everyone else?
@27727232970  @27813501310 
How's the testing? Can we see an increase in coverage and is our build passing?

@27787256911 did you make it send the info to the dining hall page? And the you fix the dining hall staff?
[2020/09/10, 11:40:09] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: Not yet I’ve been doing PC, AAA and OS
[2020/09/10, 11:40:18] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: I’ll get it done today
[2020/09/10, 11:40:23] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: Check in
[2020/09/10, 11:46:34] Kabelo AKA Kabi: check in
[2020/09/10, 11:54:17] Demi: How's the testing? 
Are you done?
[2020/09/10, 11:54:57] Kabelo AKA Kabi: again demi i can't test functions that you haven't written. i'll link you to the video
[2020/09/10, 11:55:27] Demi: No one asked you to do that
Are you done yes or no?
[2020/09/10, 11:56:00] Kabelo AKA Kabi: i'm done but i can do a lot more. write functions and then i will test them
[2020/09/10, 11:56:29] Demi: If you wanna do more
Assit dudu
[2020/09/10, 11:56:47] Demi: That's the testing that actually matters cause it relates to our coverage
[2020/09/10, 11:57:05] Demi: Yes new job for you
Try to get the build to pass
[2020/09/10, 11:57:17] Duduzile Coms: Check in

Right now I’m working on the errors that are making the build fail
[2020/09/10, 11:58:30] Kabelo AKA Kabi: i spent a few days trying to figure out firebase testing. not sure how long it'll take me to figure out ionic testing but i'll try
[2020/09/10, 12:21:43] Senate⚡️: Ayt, just did that 🤞🏽
[2020/09/10, 12:27:18] Kabelo AKA Kabi: dudu can you please send me the stuff you're working on? or just snippets of where you're getting problems?

[2020/09/10, 13:05:05] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: I don’t know
[2020/09/10, 13:05:38] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: Is this on Travis
[2020/09/10, 13:08:03] Duduzile Coms: Yeah
[2020/09/10, 13:08:25] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: What’s the error
[2020/09/10, 13:08:46] Duduzile Coms: That’s what I’m trying to figure out
[2020/09/10, 13:09:20] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: Oh this might be the same problem I had
[2020/09/10, 13:10:09] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: Which is that calls from some of the ngInit() functions call Firebase and it times out
‎[2020/09/10, 13:11:13] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: ‎image omitted
[2020/09/10, 13:12:07] Duduzile Coms: So how do we fix that?
‎[2020/09/10, 13:12:32] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: ‎image omitted
[2020/09/10, 13:13:15] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: I never got around to fixing it because Firebase was only added in the last sprint and I decided to stop testing
[2020/09/10, 13:13:29] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: This is just my assumption though I’m not entirely sure
[2020/09/10, 13:14:10] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: You could find out how to test calls to Firebase or create dummy functions to mock calls and responses to Firebase (if that is the issue)
[2020/09/10, 13:14:39] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: You can probably check if that is the issue by removing calls to Firebase and seeing if the tests run
‎[2020/09/10, 13:16:44] Senate⚡️: ‎image omitted
[2020/09/10, 13:17:22] Kabelo AKA Kabi: that's a good idea
[2020/09/10, 13:18:33] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: That’s fine by me
[2020/09/10, 13:19:03] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: I will say from experience that testing is perhaps the most difficult job overall
[2020/09/10, 13:19:10] Kabelo AKA Kabi: then if it works and it truly is a firebase issue i'll see what i can do i mean i'll try check anyway but yea
[2020/09/10, 13:19:53] Senate⚡️: Okay. I’ll check he’s calendar when I get home and confirm time with y’all
‎[2020/09/10, 13:20:01] Duduzile Coms: ‎audio omitted
[2020/09/10, 13:20:07] Senate⚡️: *his 🤧

[2020/09/10, 13:22:27] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: Only clicking the button tries to communicate with Firebase
[2020/09/10, 13:22:55] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: Also which branch are you on because I just merged test into my branch
[2020/09/10, 13:23:24] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: And the files on my branch don’t have tests
[2020/09/10, 13:23:45] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: So you can use my branch to check if that’s what you need
[2020/09/10, 13:24:10] Demi: Aiit
set it for Monday
[2020/09/10, 13:24:48] Duduzile Coms: It added files to the test branch which is the branch I’m trying to fix
[2020/09/10, 13:25:24] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: I didn’t intentionally merge to the test branch
[2020/09/10, 13:25:35] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: I merged the test branch into my branch
[2020/09/10, 13:25:54] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: My bad though
[2020/09/10, 13:26:00] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: Should I roll back?
[2020/09/10, 13:26:16] Duduzile Coms: No it’s fine
[2020/09/10, 13:27:30] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: Ok
[2020/09/10, 13:27:50] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: When I get my tasks done I’ll try to help where I can
[2020/09/10, 13:43:16] Duduzile Coms: Thank you
[2020/09/10, 14:18:24] Senate⚡️: I booked 14:30 so that we have enough time to make changes
[2020/09/10, 15:02:14] Duduzile Coms: @27727232970 please help me find this or any log log file
[2020/09/10, 15:02:57] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: I think that file would be on the virtual machine on Travis’ end
[2020/09/10, 15:38:40] Kabelo AKA Kabi: okay will do
[2020/09/10, 16:48:34] Kabelo AKA Kabi: apparently you can get a dump of the error logs?
[2020/09/10, 17:12:32] Duduzile Coms: Where? How?

[2020/09/10, 17:45:41] Senate⚡️: Side note, Kabi. Could you please send me the Process view diagram for sprint 2? I was reordering stuff on GitHub and I can’t find it on taiga. I only found the activity diagram
[2020/09/10, 18:09:09] Kabelo AKA Kabi: so you're looking for the sequence diagram?
[2020/09/10, 18:11:25] Kabelo AKA Kabi: i think that's the time when there wasn't anything to add to the sequence diagram so i just did the activity diagram
[2020/09/10, 18:18:06] Senate⚡️: Oh yes, that’s what I meant
[2020/09/10, 18:18:15] Senate⚡️: Oh okay 👌🏽
[2020/09/10, 19:27:23] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: Are we still supposed to show comments? Where does that happen?

[2020/09/10, 19:45:30] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: I also can’t get to the buy books page

[2020/09/10, 19:49:20] Demi: Honestly I'm not sure
I think so but I don't know for sure
Maybe like in that same place?

Make sure we can get and display the average rating for a meal, you'll have to code that calculation.
I've already created a field for each meal to hold average ratings
[2020/09/10, 19:49:40] Demi: Whichever one let's you transfer the meal info so we upload to firebase
[2020/09/10, 19:50:04] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: Both would work
[2020/09/10, 19:50:52] Senate⚡️: No you didn’t 🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️ I honestly don’t get what’s wrong. Please just copy and paste the buy books module that’s there in the main-tabs.routing.rs
[2020/09/10, 19:51:14] Demi: Whichever one is better looking
[2020/09/10, 19:51:19] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: Ok
[2020/09/10, 19:52:00] Senate⚡️: Like it makes no sense why that error is 😪 I swear it’s like an Android studio level typa error 💯

[2020/09/10, 19:57:52] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: Or is it fine if I make it like this
‎[2020/09/10, 20:03:58] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: ‎image omitted
[2020/09/11, 10:55:39] Demi: Check in

Don't forget to upload the diagram by the end of the day

The page still isn't going to books page
Dining hall staff page is still getting the wrong info and we need to see the average ratings for each restaurant 
All this needs to be done by Monday
[2020/09/11, 10:56:24] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: Check in
[2020/09/11, 10:56:55] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: I fixed the dining hall page and the dining hall staff info
[2020/09/11, 10:57:18] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: I haven’t pushed it because I don’t want to mess with what Dudu’s doing
[2020/09/11, 10:57:50] Senate⚡️: Uhm 🤔 I might have made a mistake
[2020/09/11, 10:57:51] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: I mean the pages route properly now
[2020/09/11, 10:57:59] Senate⚡️: Check in
[2020/09/11, 10:58:00] Demi: Nice
Push it, she's doing testing so it shouldn't affect it
[2020/09/11, 10:58:23] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: Yesterday she asked me to hold off on merges and pushing
[2020/09/11, 10:58:46] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: Also I combined all the meal pages into a single page so that will give new testing issues
[2020/09/11, 10:58:59] Kabelo AKA Kabi: Check in
[2020/09/11, 10:59:24] Duduzile Coms: Check in
[2020/09/11, 11:00:11] Demi: Well you definitely have to push it now
It's better to get started on the new testing now instead of when she fixes the old one and tind out it isn't what we're using
[2020/09/11, 11:00:30] Demi: *finds
[2020/09/11, 11:00:42] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: There’s no place to display the averages currently I’ll add that
[2020/09/11, 11:00:58] Demi: Ok
[2020/09/11, 11:01:40] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: For the averages I’m going to add an array that stores all the values just to make it easier to calculate the averages
[2020/09/11, 11:02:05] Demi: Okay
[2020/09/11, 11:04:38] Duduzile Coms: You can do that it’s fine
[2020/09/11, 11:04:58] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: Ok cool
[2020/09/11, 14:02:47] Demi: Buy books isn't displaying the books from the database 
Something about an invalid argument refFromURL

Sell books doesn't have a description field

I'll try and fix em but anyone can do it, just let the group know if you've fixed.
[2020/09/11, 14:03:13] Demi: @27813501310 @27727232970 can you check in
[2020/09/11, 14:03:34] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: I fixed it
[2020/09/11, 14:04:07] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: You just need to make it take the first element of the [img-REF] because I turned it into an array
[2020/09/11, 14:04:45] Demi: Which one?
[2020/09/11, 14:04:49] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: so [‘img-REF’][0]
[2020/09/11, 14:05:05] Demi: Where do I find this?
[2020/09/11, 14:05:05] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: The displaying books
[2020/09/11, 14:05:14] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: Buy books
[2020/09/11, 14:23:47] Demi: Cannot match any routes. URL segment:'dh-staff-main'
[2020/09/11, 14:24:49] Demi: After ordering once it keeps taking me to the home page of dining hall or textbook 

Is that on purpose or a bug?
[2020/09/11, 14:31:45] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: You need to route to home/dh-staff-main
‎[2020/09/11, 14:32:13] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: ‎image omitted
[2020/09/11, 14:33:20] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: That’s how Senate set it up and I kept it like that
[2020/09/11, 14:33:25] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: Change it if you want
[2020/09/11, 14:34:00] Demi: But it was working before
What happend now?
[2020/09/11, 14:34:29] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: What was working
[2020/09/11, 14:34:39] Demi: The staff page
[2020/09/11, 14:35:07] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: Maybe I took it out of the public pages or maybe it’s because I changed the folder structure
[2020/09/11, 14:35:08] Demi: Also what's this in reference to?
[2020/09/11, 14:35:23] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: Senate made it route back
[2020/09/11, 14:35:24] Demi: Aiit
Fix it
[2020/09/11, 14:35:36] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: Fix it how
[2020/09/11, 14:35:48] Demi: When?
[2020/09/11, 14:36:06] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: When she made the page
[2020/09/11, 14:36:24] Demi: But it wasnt like that before 
Like with the previous version
[2020/09/11, 14:36:34] Demi: Add the correct route
[2020/09/11, 14:37:00] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: Ok I did
[2020/09/11, 14:37:36] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: I’m not pushing it until I’m done figuring out file uploads so if you want to see that page you’re gonna have to fix it yourself for now
[2020/09/11, 14:38:28] Demi: Just push the current version
There's no point in me fixing something you've already done besides I need to check something
[2020/09/11, 14:38:53] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: I’m working on things
[2020/09/11, 14:39:23] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: You just have to put home before she-staff-main
[2020/09/11, 14:39:52] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: Pushing it means I’ll have to stash, swap branches and merge
[2020/09/11, 15:15:46] Duduzile Coms: Check in
[2020/09/11, 15:16:35] Kabelo AKA Kabi: check
[2020/09/11, 15:16:41] Kabelo AKA Kabi: in
[2020/09/11, 16:48:52] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: I’m getting permission error when trying to update Amount Left
[2020/09/11, 16:53:36] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: Also not all of the reviews have ratings so the average won’t work
[2020/09/11, 16:56:27] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: Also could you add an array of ratings to each meal item, i think having all of the ratings in a single array will work better than having to cycle through all the review and adding and dividing all their ratings every time
[2020/09/11, 16:58:05] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: I made the changes for convocation so I can test it but I’m not gonna do it for all of them
[2020/09/11, 17:05:18] Demi: Add it yourself 
You already added things that we agreed shouldn't be added
[2020/09/11, 17:05:27] Demi: So who's gonna do it? Cause that's your job
[2020/09/11, 17:05:37] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: When did we agree
[2020/09/11, 17:06:20] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: You said “okay”
[2020/09/11, 17:06:35] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: Since when is the backend my job?
[2020/09/11, 17:08:12] Demi: We had a whole meeting about combing the pages and that should be left at Dudu's discretion cause she's doing the testing. That's the reason we gave Dudu and kabelo the testing but you combined the pages which is what started the argument a while ago
[2020/09/11, 17:08:32] Demi: To the reviews stuff not combing the pages into one
[2020/09/11, 17:08:41] Demi: Clearly you do whatever you like
[2020/09/11, 17:08:47] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: I’m sorry I misunderstood
[2020/09/11, 17:09:02] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: I thought we agreed that I would combine the pages
[2020/09/11, 17:10:23] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: I said it would make it easier to do the reviewing and testing
[2020/09/11, 17:11:08] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: I’ll roll back the changes
[2020/09/11, 17:12:00] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: But you still have to add the relevant fields to the back for calculating the review averages that you asked me to implement
[2020/09/11, 17:18:19] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: Ok Demi, how do you want me to calculate the averages?
[2020/09/11, 17:27:19] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: @27742777535 tell me how you want it implemented. I want to do the averages and you don’t want me to do it my way, so please tell me how you want it done so I can do
[2020/09/11, 17:28:39] Demi: Do it however you like
[2020/09/11, 17:28:54] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: I can’t do it how I like because you don’t want to add the fields
[2020/09/11, 17:28:58] Demi: If everything is working there's no point
[2020/09/11, 17:29:00] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: And that’s totally cool
[2020/09/11, 17:29:18] Demi: You've got access to firebase, you can do it yourself
[2020/09/11, 17:29:23] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: But not all the reviews have ratings and so it’s going to break
[2020/09/11, 17:29:58] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: Ok so it’s not your job?
[2020/09/11, 17:30:02] Demi: You can add ratings reviews
[2020/09/11, 17:30:14] Demi: *You can add standin ratings
[2020/09/11, 17:31:31] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: There’s also a permissions issue idk if that’s your job
[2020/09/11, 17:31:43] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: I’ll just do it is fine
[2020/09/11, 17:34:24] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: I’m honestly willing to change it back if it upset you, I really thought I had permission. I even remember offering to do the back end changes myself because I thought you said no because it would inconvenience you
[2020/09/11, 17:43:46] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: For clarity, is adding things to the backend my job or not?
[2020/09/11, 17:49:00] Demi: Like I said if everything is working there's no point
[2020/09/11, 17:49:25] Demi: I mean it wasn't but you already added things to the backend so I guess it doesn't matter
[2020/09/11, 17:49:42] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: Omg Demi I asked and you said ok
[2020/09/11, 17:49:52] Demi: Everyone make sure your diagram is up

Also close your tasks on taiga it it's done
Let's make sure the app us ready by Monday
[2020/09/11, 17:49:56] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: If you don’t want me to add it
[2020/09/11, 17:50:52] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: Demi, I’m really tired. And every time i tell you something I need from the back you turn it into an argument
[2020/09/11, 17:51:52] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: And so to avoid this whole argument, I asked you how you wanted me to do it. But you told me to do it how I wanted. But I i need fields to be added
[2020/09/11, 17:52:05] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: So I’m really at a loss about how to proceeed
[2020/09/11, 17:53:23] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: Like I’m sorry if you feel like I’m being difficult, I’m just trying to calculate averages and I’m tell you what I need to do that. I don’t know what to otherwise.
[2020/09/11, 17:58:03] Demi: Done
[2020/09/11, 17:58:49] Demi: *the fields are done
[2020/09/11, 18:22:46] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: Honestly I’m hesitant to ask for things now
[2020/09/11, 18:23:25] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: But anyways I’m getting permission errors when I try updating the averages and the amounts that users have left over
[2020/09/11, 18:24:01] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: Idk whose job that is or what I need to do
[2020/09/11, 19:30:18] Demi: The averages permission is the same as the ordering permission, are you sending the uid field with the right uid string?

I'll fix the amounts stuff in abit
[2020/09/11, 20:11:54] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: I don’t think I can pass the uid to update the averages because different users will be commenting unless it’s ok that the last person that commented’s uid is part of the meal’s document
‎[2020/09/11, 20:12:25] ‪+27 78 725 6911‬: ‎image omitted
[2020/09/11, 20:55:50] Demi: Oh ya
I guess we could create a dummy viarable to hold the uid just for safety precautions or I could remove that particular permission
[2020/09/11, 20:56:19] Demi: I think I'll remove that permission cause the app is pretty secure
[2020/09/11, 20:59:37] Demi: Oh apparently I didn't add the permission so you should be good

[2020/09/13, 10:35:55] Demi:
[2020/09/14, 01:38:03] Duduzile Coms: One of the things affecting the build is that the npm run command had an incorrect option.

Now the issue is that the Travic VM can’t start Chrome
[2020/09/14, 01:39:43] Duduzile Coms: There isn’t much help online as this is usually caused by incorrect tests, but the command works perfectly on my machine... does anyone know have an idea on how to fix this?
[2020/09/14, 08:41:29] Senate⚡️: I don’t know but I just have a side question. Are the tests passing when you run them?
[2020/09/14, 09:39:12] Senate⚡️: Kabelo, please upload your diagrams.
