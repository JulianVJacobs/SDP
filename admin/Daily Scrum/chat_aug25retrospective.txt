[2020/08/10, 16:39:36] Demi: I'm getting Network error when I try to login with the latest appüòì
[2020/08/10, 16:45:14] Julian Jacobs: i don't think so
[2020/08/10, 16:45:22] Julian Jacobs: i'm still figuring out things for the bacl
[2020/08/10, 16:46:20] Julian Jacobs: display the number of orders on dh-staff_main
[2020/08/10, 16:48:58] Senate‚ö°Ô∏è: I thought I did that? No?
[2020/08/10, 16:50:09] Senate‚ö°Ô∏è: Oh üòì doesn‚Äôt it count for a lot of marks?
[2020/08/10, 17:11:12] Julian Jacobs: no
[2020/08/10, 17:11:24] Julian Jacobs: i mean you can check but no number is displayed
[2020/08/10, 17:11:34] Julian Jacobs: idk should i do that instead?
[2020/08/10, 17:11:58] Julian Jacobs: and you're running the server?
[2020/08/10, 17:13:10] Julian Jacobs: when i get Network Error it's because i'm not running the server
[2020/08/10, 17:15:23] Julian Jacobs: i'm struggling to get the order query to work. i've only gotten it to work 3 times i'm not sure what's happening
[2020/08/10, 17:20:26] Demi: Ya now I'm running the server but nothing is happening 
I'll try figure it out

What exactly are you doing now, cause looking at this it's already connected so we can help do other things cause for me the connection was the confusing part
[2020/08/10, 17:34:23] Julian Jacobs: ok
[2020/08/10, 17:34:30] Julian Jacobs: i was doing the actual ordering system
[2020/08/10, 17:34:39] Julian Jacobs: i figured it out now
[2020/08/10, 17:38:26] Julian Jacobs: you can do sign up
[2020/08/10, 17:39:12] Demi: Aiit
Upload the latest version
[2020/08/10, 17:39:43] Demi: That might take me a while I can't log in meaning I think for some reason the server isn't connecting to my local mysql
[2020/08/10, 18:01:52] Demi: Can you do the sign up page
Cause my stuff isn't connecting
[2020/08/10, 19:04:48] Julian Jacobs: i did now. i think all the necessary functions are there
[2020/08/10, 19:07:49] Julian Jacobs: there's also a new dump
[2020/08/11, 00:05:39] Demi: Cool
Then you're presenting
[2020/08/11, 15:32:17] Senate‚ö°Ô∏è: The code to display is there but it might need to be tweaked to the database name or something like that
[2020/08/11, 15:32:57] Demi: Dudu
Kabelo
Where are you
[2020/08/11, 15:32:58] Demi: ?
[2020/08/11, 15:35:29] Kabelo AKA Kabi: i'm trying to log on but you know my connection problems
[2020/08/11, 15:36:55] Senate‚ö°Ô∏è: Okay
[2020/08/11, 15:37:08] Duduzile Coms: Coming

[2020/08/12, 09:51:40] Julian Jacobs: yeah i'm free
[2020/08/12, 10:52:22] Demi: Can we make it in the afternoon? Around 1?
If we can't then it's fine
[2020/08/12, 11:15:12] Senate‚ö°Ô∏è: Okay, he‚Äôs busy at 13:00 so I‚Äôll book 14:30
[2020/08/12, 11:18:17] Senate‚ö°Ô∏è: Julian are you free then? Your calendar says you have something at 14:15
[2020/08/13, 12:26:48] Julian Jacobs: i am not free then
[2020/08/13, 13:58:54] Senate‚ö°Ô∏è: Okay cool. I booked 3:15
[2020/08/14, 14:52:14] Demi: I can't make the meeting
Load shedding I don't think it will be back by 3:30
I'll try to make it if my battery isn't dead and I manage to get good enough network coverage
[2020/08/14, 14:59:37] Senate‚ö°Ô∏è: Okay üò∞ please try your bestest
[2020/08/14, 15:00:10] Senate‚ö°Ô∏è: Everyone else, please be there, it‚Äôs at 15:15 üôåüèΩ

[2020/08/14, 15:15:15] Senate‚ö°Ô∏è: Wait, did I send the invitation to the wrong Duduzile Nhlapo? üíÄ cause the person accepted the invitation üòÇ
[2020/08/14, 15:16:35] Julian Jacobs: it's difficult to follow the link
[2020/08/14, 15:17:00] Senate‚ö°Ô∏è: Ah I see
[2020/08/14, 15:17:10] Senate‚ö°Ô∏è: @27727232970 were waiting for you
[2020/08/14, 15:17:16] Julian Jacobs: like i have to copy the text and then paste it somewhere and then copy the link
[2020/08/14, 15:17:29] Senate‚ö°Ô∏è: Hectic

[2020/08/14, 15:19:06] Senate‚ö°Ô∏è: Oh I‚Äôm sorry, I‚Äôll be more careful next time
[2020/08/14, 15:19:52] Duduzile Coms: Can‚Äôt we start without him?
[2020/08/14, 15:40:13] Kabelo AKA Kabi: lol i'm at the mall
‚Äé[2020/08/14, 15:47:35] Demi: ‚Äéimage omitted
[2020/08/15, 12:58:23] Demi: Has anyone figured out how to use firebase?
[2020/08/15, 13:20:00] Duduzile Coms: It's a bit difficult but I'm getting there
[2020/08/15, 13:22:11] Kabelo AKA Kabi: i'm not having much luck on my side
[2020/08/15, 14:01:17] Demi: Keep trying because we need to figure this our before the next review. Report back if you figure it out
[2020/08/15, 15:07:36] Duduzile Coms: Okay I will
[2020/08/15, 20:46:25] Kabelo AKA Kabi: no problem
[2020/08/16, 20:34:51] Demi: Some of the tasks have been uploaded. Click on your task to see the description, this will be the format from now on

The rest will follow soon
We only have a short time before the next sprint and we have more to do so everyone should hurry up with their tasks.

Follow exactly what is written in the description and if you feel something is not right message me and we can fix it.

Open each user story to see all your tasks. 



Uhm the database how close is it to being done?
[2020/08/16, 20:38:19] Demi: Since the next Retrospective is on the 25th
We should meet Rylan on the 24th
[2020/08/16, 21:28:18] Demi: I've uploaded all the tasks.
If something comes up during the week I'll add more

Also daily scrum, this guy checks and we saw it so let's make an effort cause it's free marks unless you all don't mind losing those marks
[2020/08/16, 21:29:23] Demi: Unless something comes up
Our next meeting is on the 23rd at 4:30

Kabelo make it to the meeting.
[2020/08/16, 21:49:31] Kabelo AKA Kabi: yea you see this is good prior warning
[2020/08/17, 04:00:01] Demi: Finally figured out how to read from and write to firebase üòì
I'll start on the structures and other stuff but that might take some time
[2020/08/17, 14:20:55] Kabelo AKA Kabi: this man up at 4am figuring firebase out. what a boss
[2020/08/17, 17:11:19] Demi: Nah not even üòÇ just glad we finally figured it out
[2020/08/17, 22:35:09] Kabelo AKA Kabi: yea it was stressing me out i was even doing some research on microsoft azure to see if we could use that
[2020/08/18, 02:33:41] Demi: I forgot about the MS database
[2020/08/18, 10:10:27] Kabelo AKA Kabi: it's pure sql, read and write. not sure about how its features differ from those of firebase with a free account but it looks a lot more straight forward
[2020/08/18, 12:45:59] Demi: Keep working on that while I work on firebase. If you can figure out that database before I do with mine then we might go with that one
[2020/08/18, 13:05:38] Kabelo AKA Kabi: sure. thing is i tried making an account with my wits email account and it said i'm not allowed to create a free azure database which is very weird. but i'll keep going at it
[2020/08/19, 15:36:14] Senate‚ö°Ô∏è: I sent an email to you guys with just a few objectives we should probably have completed before the sprint retrospective. I think they're all fairly reasonable
[2020/08/20, 02:55:30] Demi: So I've created most of the database
Everyone should look at it as it helps with this week's tasks
I created a dining hall collection with different dining halls and their various meals and the prices of those meals
All that's left in the database is the comment and the ordering

Also firebase has it's own authentication I think we should use that
I've implemented the signing in and creating account on node
So all I'm left with on node is to write the code for send and recieving reviews.
Also for pushing the order and checking how many has been ordered

I trust everyone has familiarized themselves with firebase cause there's gang vids explaining it in detail.
I'll upload my code when I'm done but you can see the actual database with the dining halls and the users under authentication and cloud store firestore
[2020/08/20, 02:57:23] Demi: Also I trust everyone has at least started their tasks 
Cause time is short and we're meeting on sunday then meeting with rylan on Monday for sprint review 

@27732121491 set the meeting with rylan on Monday, preferably in the afternoon
[2020/08/20, 18:40:49] Senate‚ö°Ô∏è: Okay
[2020/08/20, 18:41:57] Senate‚ö°Ô∏è: I just wanna know, can I continue on the app that I have or have you any changes been made to it? @27813501310 @27604103099?
[2020/08/20, 18:43:02] Julian Jacobs: idk what app you have
[2020/08/20, 18:55:54] Senate‚ö°Ô∏è: The one that I uploaded on GitHub
[2020/08/20, 18:58:50] Julian Jacobs: yeah i changed it
[2020/08/20, 18:59:38] Julian Jacobs: if you uploaded anything before the retrospective, what i showed in the retrospective is what i pushed to the test branch
[2020/08/20, 19:00:13] Julian Jacobs: can we have one main branch and then everyone do what they need to on their own separate branch
[2020/08/20, 19:01:14] Julian Jacobs: i think this might because we're tracking one version of the work when i think branching is meant to make it so that everyone makes changes relevant to their task to a copy of the current main product and then they just add it on
[2020/08/20, 19:04:33] Senate‚ö°Ô∏è: Alright I‚Äôll use your version and create my own branch
[2020/08/20, 19:05:31] Julian Jacobs: i don't think my version has the back end stuff
[2020/08/20, 19:06:12] Julian Jacobs: i think the test branch would be better? idk what changes have been made to it since i last worked on it so it's probably the most up to date version
[2020/08/20, 19:07:04] Senate‚ö°Ô∏è: Okay ü•¥ the back end stuff is probably @27813501310 then. Dudu which version should I use?
[2020/08/20, 19:09:09] Julian Jacobs: i checked and test was modified 2 days ago
[2020/08/20, 19:09:18] Julian Jacobs: so test is the most recent version
[2020/08/21, 03:27:53] Demi: So I've uploaded the back end important code
I havent uploaded the node module cause it'll take too long and I'm going to bed but I'll do it later today

Julian combine it, my code does everything it needs to do, I've tested it but you also have to test it cause of firebase.
Try running firebase login on your console
If it's giving you errors then you'll have to watch youtube vids on how to setup the proper environment for firebase I also had to do that and read multiple pages.I don't think anything apart from the connection needs to be touched or added.
If you can wait for me to upload the node modules then you might not need to do much setting up.

The code is mostly commented out but just uncomment each block of code and you see commented lines that explain. Also the variable names are straight forward. If it has a weird name don't touch it


Everybody should have their stuff ready by Sunday 4:30pm
[2020/08/21, 10:29:02] Julian Jacobs: what am i editing? backend or Firebase backend?
[2020/08/21, 10:55:32] Julian Jacobs: i don't think i'm sure what i'm supposed to be combining and with what?
[2020/08/21, 11:01:41] Demi: Node
When a user clicks on something in the frontend
The relevant code is called
[2020/08/21, 11:01:46] Demi: In the backend
[2020/08/21, 11:02:16] Demi: It's basically what you did last semester 
Except this time we're using firebase
[2020/08/21, 11:02:46] Julian Jacobs: so like making the code for the SQL work for Firebase
[2020/08/21, 11:03:21] Demi: What?
[2020/08/21, 11:03:22] Julian Jacobs: is there already code for retrieval and stuff for Firebase or do i have to write it
‚Äé[2020/08/21, 11:04:14] Julian Jacobs: ‚Äéimage omitted
[2020/08/21, 11:04:16] Demi: The first line says I've uploaded the code
[2020/08/21, 11:04:40] Demi: This explains everything
‚Äé[2020/08/21, 11:05:06] Julian Jacobs: ‚Äéimage omitted
[2020/08/21, 11:05:12] Julian Jacobs: is this the code?
[2020/08/21, 11:05:13] Demi: What were need from this is the 
app.post(/
[2020/08/21, 11:05:44] Demi: Ya
Every file in that folder is important
[2020/08/21, 11:06:08] Julian Jacobs: that's what i was asking. am i writing for backend or Firebase backend?
[2020/08/21, 11:07:10] Julian Jacobs: ok yeah i can do that
[2020/08/21, 11:07:36] Julian Jacobs: am i doing it only for creating users? so only sign up?
[2020/08/21, 11:07:55] Demi: Yeah
So like when a user clicks create account take the values and send it to the back end and call the block of code for signing up
[2020/08/21, 11:09:28] Demi: No
For signing up
Signing in
Posting reviews
Placing orders
Getting comments and putting them in rue right place in the frontend
[2020/08/21, 11:09:47] Julian Jacobs: but there's only skeleton code for the creating users
[2020/08/21, 11:10:13] Julian Jacobs: ok i think i'm going to focus on code coverage and testing today
[2020/08/21, 11:10:25] Julian Jacobs: and i'll see if i can do the integration tomorrow
[2020/08/21, 11:10:29] Demi: Also for the staff to get how many people ordered a particular meal
[2020/08/21, 11:10:38] Demi: Just have everything done by Sunday
[2020/08/21, 11:11:42] Demi: I'd advice getting started on firebase early 
Cause setting it up is a problem and spent a lot of time just trying to get it to connect
[2020/08/21, 11:12:29] Julian Jacobs: ok send the resources that helped you
[2020/08/21, 11:14:39] Demi: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9jUPIes_B8vRjn1_GaplOPQ

Everyone needs to watch it cause everyone needs to set their various environment
Also when everyone has downloaded the service key we need to delete it off github, I already got an email warning
[2020/08/21, 11:15:08] Demi: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9itfjle0ji1xOZ2cjRGY_WB
[2020/08/21, 11:17:46] Demi: https://youtu.be/Z87OZtIYC_0
[2020/08/21, 21:41:43] Julian Jacobs: i just got the build to pass
[2020/08/21, 21:42:01] Julian Jacobs: the coverage is awful but that's another day's problem
[2020/08/22, 19:44:17] Julian Jacobs: can anyone help me with the coverage? i'm really not sure what is going on
[2020/08/22, 20:26:52] Duduzile Coms: I'll look through it and see what I can do
[2020/08/23, 11:05:16] Julian Jacobs: i found out i can only create new users if i change the rules of the Firebase
[2020/08/23, 11:05:56] Julian Jacobs: i changed it to see if it worked and then i changed it back because i didn't want anything to break
[2020/08/23, 11:11:31] Demi: The call was an accident
[2020/08/23, 11:11:46] Demi: Why can't you create new users?
[2020/08/23, 11:11:51] Demi: Did it work?
[2020/08/23, 11:11:57] Julian Jacobs: permissions error
[2020/08/23, 11:12:11] Julian Jacobs: when i changed the rules yeah
[2020/08/23, 11:13:11] Demi: Then keep it changed cause you might need to create new users.
Just make sure it doesn't affect anyone else
[2020/08/23, 11:13:35] Julian Jacobs: i can't be sure it won't affect other things
[2020/08/23, 11:13:40] Julian Jacobs: that's why i undid it
[2020/08/23, 11:14:16] Julian Jacobs: i think the rules have to be reconsidered i'll give you a detailed output of the permission error
[2020/08/23, 11:14:23] Demi: What line did you add or alter?
[2020/08/23, 11:17:08] Julian Jacobs: of the rules?
[2020/08/23, 11:17:28] Julian Jacobs: you can check the history thing
[2020/08/23, 11:17:48] Julian Jacobs: i changed the false to true on line 5
[2020/08/23, 11:19:40] Demi: Aiit
Keep it on true for now
We're going to have to experiment so keep it on true. And just test the other part of the code to make sure they're working 
I'm assuming you tried to create a new user using the code
[2020/08/23, 11:23:01] Julian Jacobs: yeah
[2020/08/23, 11:23:09] Julian Jacobs: on trying to create a new user
[2020/08/23, 11:32:31] Julian Jacobs: also the format for new user's data you gave me doesn't match the users on the Firestore
[2020/08/23, 11:34:04] Demi: What format?
It should match cause I created the user holly wood using the node js I gave you. And I also signed in with that user to make sure it worked
[2020/08/23, 11:35:30] Demi: So what the code is supposed to do is create a user ok the authentication table
Then add the unique ID and extra info to the users collection in firestore. That way we can store anything from the user that we want
[2020/08/23, 11:35:42] Demi: *on

[2020/08/23, 11:39:13] Julian Jacobs: i diiiiid use the Holly Wood format though
[2020/08/23, 11:42:12] Demi: Oh what do you mean by format?
Student number is:123456@students.wits.ac.za 
Password:123456789

I had to make it an email cause it needed to be an email cause of the authentication
[2020/08/23, 11:43:24] Demi: The documents are the unique key that is given to them by the authentication table.
I had to do it this way cause it's safer and takes advantage of the firebase authentication
[2020/08/23, 11:59:13] Julian Jacobs: yeah i think i see what you mean
[2020/08/23, 11:59:38] Julian Jacobs: i was confused because the other entries have DH ID as an element
[2020/08/23, 12:01:42] Demi: Oh I see
It's because their role is 1(owners of dining halls) and the DH ID is the dining hall they own.
It matches the dining hall documents in the dining hall collection 
Role 0 is student
[2020/08/23, 16:42:34] Demi: Where's everyone?

[2020/08/23, 17:25:53] Kabelo AKA Kabi: yea i went to the google meet instead and found no one there
[2020/08/23, 17:26:49] Julian Jacobs: we've never met on google Meet for group discussions before
[2020/08/23, 17:27:48] Demi: We were on teams 
I specifically said Sunday 4:30 and you said you'll be there cause I reminded you early

Just upload your diagrams and so the daily scrum
Also make a summary of our last meeting with Rylan, use the format Senate used and send it to ke
[2020/08/23, 17:27:49] Demi: Me
[2020/08/23, 17:28:01] Demi: *do
[2020/08/23, 17:31:15] Kabelo AKA Kabi: i thought today was the meeting with rylan
